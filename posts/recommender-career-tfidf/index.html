<h3 id="what-are-we-trying-to-do">What are we trying to do</h3>
<p>We will build a very simple recommendation engine using Text Data. To demostrate this we would use a case study approach and build a recommendation engine for a non profit organization <strong>Career Village</strong>.</p>
<p>CareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&amp;A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.</p>
<p>The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.</p>
<p>To date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.</p>
<p>We will use the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions asked by the students</li>
<li>Answers provided by the professionals and the professionals details</li>
</ul>
<p>When a student asks a question, we would find <strong>similar questions</strong> which have been answered. Then we would connect the student question with the professional so that the professional can ask the question. In this blog post, we would explain the detailed strategy of finding similar questions.</p>
<h3 id="main-steps">Main Steps</h3>
<p>The main steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The questions have body and title. We make a consolidated column combining <em>body and the title</em> .</li>
<li>We make a <strong>TF-IDF</strong> vector for each of the questions text column and also of the question asked by the student.</li>
<li>We calculate the <strong>cosine similarity</strong> between the question asked and the consolidated list of questions. This would enable us select the top ten similarities and  recommend the question to the professionals who have answered it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>TF-IDF</strong></p>
<p>We would explore this using a fascinating concept known as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. Quite a mouthful, but we will unpack it and clarify each and every term.</p>
<p>A document in this case is the question text</p>
<p>Therefore we have different documents for each Author.</p>
<p>From the book <strong>5 Algorithms Every Web Developer</strong> Can Use and Understand</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TF-IDF computes a weight which represents the importance of a term inside a document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does this by comparing the frequency of usage inside an individual document as opposed to the entire data set (a collection of documents). The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the individual document itself–this is called Term Frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if multiple documents contain the same word many times then you run into a problem. That’s why TF-IDF also offsets this value by the frequency of the term in the entire document set, a value called Inverse Document Frequency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) /    
   (Total number of terms in the document)     

IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).
Value = TF * IDF   
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Cosine similarity</strong></p>
<p>If we have 2 vectors A and B, cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between them. If A and B are very similar, the value is closer to 1 and if they are very dissimilar, the value is closer to zero.</p>
<p>Here we represent the question as vectors. The values of the vector is the tfidf value of the various words in the question text.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>The data can be found in Kaggle in the following link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-careervillage">Career Village</a></p>
<h3 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h3>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the questions data , answers data and the professionals data</li>
<li>Create the consolidated dataset which has the questions, answers and the professionals dataset for each question</li>
<li>Create a consolidated column of text data composed of the question body and question title</li>
<li>Create a TF-IDF matrix of the question data</li>
<li>Create the cosine similarity matrix of the question asked and the questions answered</li>
<li>Display the highest similarity questions and their answers</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 1 - questions data , answers data and the professionals data</strong></p>

<p><strong>2nd best answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should search for Algorithm videos. Usually when studying data, you would need to know about databases structure, analytics skills, and some other logics. Another thing you could do would be start analyzing some small real cases like how long does it take to go from your house to the supermarket and what you could do to reduce the time? or how often do you drink water (time gap between each occurence). How could you track that? and how could you improve it? is it good?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->these are a few examples on how you could analyze stuff.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>3rd best answer</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hi Yingyi,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Great question and excited to see you&rsquo;re interested in Data Science. Data Science is a not really a unified field and a bit buzzwordy. Data scientist come from all sorts of backgrounds (computer science, political science, physics, statistics, even Creative Writing [me!]) and work on all sorts of problems. One one hand you&rsquo;ll may have a data scientists working with advertisement data trying to predict target audiences and click through rates and on the other a data scientist using deep learning to analyze MRI scans for cancerous tumors. And all sorts of things in between. In my role as a Data Scientist at Talla, I research machine learning and deep learning technique to solve natural language problems like teaching a computer to read text, answer questions, and classify large corpuses of data. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> You shouldn&rsquo;t worry about not having a Data Science major, your double major cover the majority of the baseline knowledge you&rsquo;ll need. Here&rsquo;s a few classes you should take to help with building skills fundamental to most data science work:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intro to Probability and Statistics<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linear Algebra <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data Structures and Algorithms <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Python <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data Visualization <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introduction to Causal Inference <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advanced (chose which one(s) look the most interesting) <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Machine Learning<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deep Learning with Neural Networks <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Natural Language Processing<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Computer Vision <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The best way to get a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to be data scientist is doing data science. A great resource for this is Kaggle and DrivenData. Both host open competitions and challenges that anyone can participate in. You should look through the challenges, see which look interesting, download the data, and start building models. Kaggle has a great set tutorials as well that well teach you the basic skills on working with data, looking for patterns and building models. The great thing is you don&rsquo;t need a college degree, just jump in. The more hands on experience you get working with data, the better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Closely related to that point is document and share the data science work you do. It will be very useful to show potential employers a portfolio of your work where you can point to specific examples of the tools, techniques and analysis you did. You can store code samples in github and write blog posts on Medium to highlight cool findings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On internships, it honestly depends on where you are located. I&rsquo;d recommend talking to your school&rsquo;s career center for help here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another piece of advice. Go on LinkedIn and look for data scientist in your area and reach out to them. Say you are a student, and ask if they have time for a phone call or coffee for questions. Professionals in general like providing advice and helping out students. So feel free to ask about what they do, things they&rsquo;d learned, and any advice they have. At the end of the conversation you might also want to ask if there are any internship opportunities and if they can recommend you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And finally in terms of general advice, study abroad if you have chance! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take some humanities and social science classes. Especially ethics, philosophy, and social or political science. Our technologies have far outpaced social norms and policies. As a data scientist you may find yourself working on human data (customers, patients, and other categories of people) and your models will have repercussions on real lives. It&rsquo;s important to the general welfare of society to be cognizant about the potential unintended consequences and implications of your work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hope this was helpful. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have questions about Data Science or post here for more advice. Good luck!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on these answers, we can recommend the question to the professionals who have answered these highest similarity questions.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We have demostrated that a simple recommendation technique can be built using Text Data , TF-IDF and Cosine similarity in the Career Village case study. We can easily extend this same technique to other text based case studies for several use cases such as recommendations for answers in  a call center , recommendations for donors who have donated for a social cause in charity organizations</p>
