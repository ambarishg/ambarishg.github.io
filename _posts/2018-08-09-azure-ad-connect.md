AD Connect provides several sign-on methods: Password Synchronization, Pass-through authentication, and Federation with AD FS. These methods are used to synchronize user accounts and, optionally, passwords from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance. Synchronization helps you to improve the productivity of your users and reduce your helpdesk costs.
