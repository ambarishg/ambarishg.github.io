We examine a dataset from **ACLED**(Armed Conflict Location and Event Project).The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project is designed for disaggregated conflict analysis and crisis mapping. This dataset codes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and protest events in dozens of developing countries in Africa. Political violence and protest includes events that occur within civil wars and periods of instability, public protest and regime breakdown. The project covers all African countries from 1997 to the present.                   


A detailed report [EDA of African Conflicts](https://www.kaggle.com/ambarish/eda-african-conflicts-with-leaflets) has the complete Data Visualization with Maps.
