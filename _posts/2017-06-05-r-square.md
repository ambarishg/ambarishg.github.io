In certain competitions such as [Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing) $$ R^2 $$ is used.
This post explains what is it in a few minutes. You can have detailed explanations in various other sources such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) .  

$$ {y_i} $$ =  Actual value of y  
$$ \hat{y} $$ =  Estimated value of y  
$$ \bar{y} $$ =  Mean value of y  

$$ R^2 = \frac{ \Sigma(\hat{y_i} - \bar{y} )^2} { \Sigma(y_i - \bar{y} )^2} $$   


Therefore if estimated value is equal to the mean , then $$ R^2 $$ is ZERO.   
If estimated value is equal to the actual value , then $$ R^2 $$ is 1.
