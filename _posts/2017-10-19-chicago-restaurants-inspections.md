Restaurant inspections ensure that food served to the public at licensed food establishments follows food safety guidelines. The **Food Protection Division of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)** is committed to maintaining the safety of food bought, sold, or prepared for public consumption in Chicago by carrying out `science-based inspections` of all retail food establishments. These inspections promote `public health` in areas of `food safety and sanitation` and prevent the occurrence of food-borne illness.
