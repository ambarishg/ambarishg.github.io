The Data management gateway is a client agent that you must install in your on-premises environment to copy data between cloud and on-premises data stores.             

Data management gateway provides the following capabilities:

*  Model on-premises data sources and cloud data sources within the same data factory and move data.                   
*  Have a single pane of glass for monitoring and management with visibility into gateway status from the Data Factory page.                    
* Manage access to on-premises data sources securely.                  
* No changes required to corporate firewall. Gateway only makes outbound HTTP-based connections to open internet.                      
* Encrypt credentials for your on-premises data stores with your certificate.                
* Move data efficiently - data is transferred in parallel, resilient to intermittent network issues with auto retry logic.
