Microsoft recommends as an Azure security best practice, at a minimum, the following three services that are part of Azure Operational Security:

* Secure your hybrid cloud resources such as virtual machines, workloads and apps with the **Azure Security Center**                          

* Protect your data in the cloud with **Azure Backup**                

* Continuously monitor your cloud health with **Azure Log Analytics**
