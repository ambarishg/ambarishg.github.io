The Azure Relay service facilitates hybrid applications by enabling you to securely `expose services that reside within a corporate enterprise network` to the public cloud, without having to open a firewall connection, or require intrusive changes to a corporate network infrastructure. Relay supports a variety of different transport protocols and web services standards.
