Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should your **distant cousin :-)** buy a 2 bedroom unit?

The  <a href="{{ site.url2 }}/public/dataviz/EDAMelHousing.html">Melbourne Housing Market</a> has a detailed analysis of the same.The analysis provides insights into the following
1. Which factors influence the house of the price most ?   
2. Which Suburbs are most costly  and least costly ?    
3. How the prices change with the 
	*  number of rooms    
	*  number of bedrooms    
.	*  distance from CBD
	*  type of the house
	*  building area
	*  number of bathrooms
