Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should your **distant cousin :-)** buy a 2 bedroom unit?

The  <a href="{{ site.url2 }}/public/dataviz/EDAMelHousing.html">Melbourne Housing Market</a> has a detailed analysis of the same.

If you are interested in the code, please find it in [github](https://github.com/ambarishg/DataVizMelbHousingMarket). The original dataset has been hosted in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market).
