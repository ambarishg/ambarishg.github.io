I"A<p>In 2016, California investigators used state wiretapping laws 563 times to capture 7.8 million communications from 181,000 people, and only 19% of these communications were incriminating. The yearâ€™s wiretaps cost nearly $30 million.</p>

<p>We know this, and much more, now that the California Department of Justice (CADOJ) for the first time has released to EFF the dataset underlying its annual wiretap report to the state legislature.</p>

<p>The  <a href="/public/dataviz/EDAWireTapping.html">California WireTapping</a> has a detailed analysis of the same.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the code, please find it in <a href="https://github.com/ambarishg/DataVizCaliforniaWireTapping">github</a>. The original dataset has been hosted in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market">Kaggle</a>.</p>
