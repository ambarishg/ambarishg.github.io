  <p>An environment is the encapsulation of the environment where training or scoring of the  machine learning model happens. The environment specifies</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Python packages,</li>
  <li>environment variables,</li>
  <li>and software settings around your training and scoring scripts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Environments are of three types
curated, user-managed, and system-managed.</p>

<p><strong>Curated environments</strong> are provided by Azure Machine Learning and are available in the workspace by default.</p>

<p>In <strong>user-managed environments</strong>, the person is  responsible for setting up the environment and installing every package that the training script needs on the compute target. Conda doesnâ€™t check the environment or install anything.</p>

# Editing a run configuration property on-fly.
user_managed_env = Environment("user-managed-env")

user_managed_env.python.user_managed_dependencies = True  

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <strong>system-managed environments</strong> when we want Conda to manage the Python environment and the script dependencies for you. A new conda environment is built based on the conda dependencies object. The Azure Machine Learning service assumes this type of environment by default, because of its usefulness on remote compute targets that arenâ€™t manually configurable.</p>
