  <p>An experiment is a grouping of many runs from a specified script. It always belongs to a workspace. When we submit a run, you provide an experiment name. Information for the run is stored under that experiment. If the name doesnâ€™t exist when you submit an experiment, a new experiment is automatically created.</p>
