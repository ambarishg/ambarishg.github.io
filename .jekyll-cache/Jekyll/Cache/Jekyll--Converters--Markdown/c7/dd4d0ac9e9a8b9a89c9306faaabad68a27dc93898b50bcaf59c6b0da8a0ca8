  <p>Approaches towards a session not just involve the topic matter, but also creating influence and motivating students to learn. I think you exactly did that. It was an absolute privilege to be able to attend your session. Thoroughly enjoyed your session. A bit of coding demonstration alongside theory was a great idea. It was an extensive 6.5 hrs long session with an hour break in between.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasure attending your session at the short term course organised at Jadavpur University. Loved your teaching style of matching the deep learning concepts to the PyTorch codes.</p>

  <p>Todayâ€™s session on deep learning was really so much interesting. Specially the description of several topics along with demos was really helpful for beginners in ML like me. Thank you so much Sir for this wonderful session and sharing such valuable information .</p>

  <p>It was really a very interesting session, especially the CNN. I was really eager about this topic but due to some reason or the other, I did not got the opportunity to gain the knowledge about this concept. I believe this will help me a lot in my coming thesis and future research works. Thanks a lot.</p>

  <p>It was a really good session. The technique of teaching the theory and practical parallelly was pretty amazing. Would love to attend another session of yours.</p>
