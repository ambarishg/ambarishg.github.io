  <p>An experiment is a grouping of many runs from a specified script. It always belongs to a workspace. When we submit a run, we provide an experiment name. Information for the run is stored under that experiment. If the name doesnâ€™t exist when we submit an experiment, a new experiment is automatically created.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>A run is a single execution of a training script. An experiment will typically contain multiple runs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Azure Machine Learning records all runs and stores the following information in the experiment:</p>

<p>Metadata about the run (timestamp, duration, and so on)
Metrics that are logged by your script
Output files that are autocollected by the experiment or explicitly uploaded by you
A snapshot of the directory that contains your scripts, prior to the run
You produce a run when you submit a script to train a model. A run can have zero or more child runs. For example, the top-level run might have two child runs, each of which might have its own child run.</p>
