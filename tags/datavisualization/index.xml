      <description>Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America&amp;rsquo;s classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.
To date, 3 million people and partners have funded 1.1 million DonorsChoose.org projects. But teachers still spend more than a billion dollars of their own money on classroom materials.</description>
