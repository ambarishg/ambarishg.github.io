      <description>We will adopt a case study approach in understanding the concepts and build a recommendation engine from scratch using TF-IDF , cosine similarity, word embeddings and deploy it in Azure ML. The series will span 5 Fridays 5PM - 6PM IST time zone.

      <description>From the TensorFlow documentation word embeddings documentation
 Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding.
  Importantly, you do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify).
  Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer).</description>

      <description>What are we trying to do We will build a very simple recommendation engine using Text Data. To demostrate this we would use a case study approach and build a recommendation engine for a non profit organization Career Village. I have detailed post on the methodology of the recommendation engine in the post here. In this post we will show of how we train, infer and deploy the solution in Azure.</description>

      <description>Restaurant inspections ensure that food served to the public at licensed food establishments follows food safety guidelines. The Food Protection Division of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is committed to maintaining the safety of food bought, sold, or prepared for public consumption in Chicago by carrying out science-based inspections of all retail food establishments. These inspections promote public health in areas of food safety and sanitation and prevent the occurrence of food-borne illness.</description>

      <description>This dataset contains the characters, locations, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes, dating back to 1989.
I had fun learning Text Mining with Simpsons.Hope you will also enjoy the same while I had writing the text mining and data visualization code.
A detailed report Fun in Text Mining with Simpsons has the complete Data Visualization with Text Mining and Modelling.</description>
