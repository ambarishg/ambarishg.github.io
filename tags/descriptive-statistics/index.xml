      <description>Binomial Probability distribution has the following characteristics:
  A fixed number of trials n. e.g., 20 coin toss , 40 students
  A binary outcome, a success and a failure. Probability of success is p, probability of failure is 1-p. e.g., head or tail in a coin toss , pass or fail of sttudents in an exam, positive and negative results of a test of a patient.
  Constant probability for each trial.</description>

      <description>Probability distribution is also known as Probability function.
 This gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes A mathematical function which maps each possible outcome x to the probability p(x) The probabilities must all sum or integrate to 1  Discrete and Continous Probability distribution Discrete probability functions can take only discrete values. Examples include Dead/ Alive , numbers obtained by rolling a die, treatment / placebo, whole numbers
Continuous probability functions can take any value within a range.</description>
