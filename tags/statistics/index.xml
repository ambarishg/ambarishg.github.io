      <description>Binomial Probability distribution has the following characteristics:
  A fixed number of trials n. e.g., 20 coin toss , 40 students
  A binary outcome, a success and a failure. Probability of success is p, probability of failure is 1-p. e.g., head or tail in a coin toss , pass or fail of sttudents in an exam, positive and negative results of a test of a patient.
  Constant probability for each trial.</description>

      <description>Sigmoid function takes values between 0 and 1
$ {sigmoid} = \frac {e^x} {( 1+ e^x )} $
This is used in logistic regression.
The sigmoid graph is generated by the R code provided below.
Softmax function is used to calculate the probablities in multiple classes. Suppose we have a image of a digit. We want to calculate whether it is a 1, 2, 3, and so on. Softmax would provide the probablity for each of the classes.</description>
