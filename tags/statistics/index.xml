      <description>Binomial Probability distribution has the following characteristics:
  A fixed number of trials n. e.g., 20 coin toss , 40 students
  A binary outcome, a success and a failure. Probability of success is p, probability of failure is 1-p. e.g., head or tail in a coin toss , pass or fail of sttudents in an exam, positive and negative results of a test of a patient.
  Constant probability for each trial.</description>

      <description>We continue our discussion of the Discrete and Continuous Probability distribution.
Blood Types - Discrete distribution function Here we present the distribution of different Blood Types
   # x p     1 O 45%   2 A 40%   3 B 11%   4 AB 4%    Emergency Room probability distribution function The number of patients seen in an Emergency Room in any given hour is provided by a random variable x</description>

      <description>Probability distribution is also known as Probability function.
 This gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes A mathematical function which maps each possible outcome x to the probability p(x) The probabilities must all sum or integrate to 1  Discrete and Continous Probability distribution Discrete probability functions can take only discrete values. Examples include Dead/ Alive , numbers obtained by rolling a die, treatment / placebo, whole numbers
Continuous probability functions can take any value within a range.</description>

      <description>Sigmoid function takes values between 0 and 1
$ {sigmoid} = \frac {e^x} {( 1+ e^x )} $
This is used in logistic regression.
The sigmoid graph is generated by the R code provided below.
Softmax function is used to calculate the probablities in multiple classes. Suppose we have a image of a digit. We want to calculate whether it is a 1, 2, 3, and so on. Softmax would provide the probablity for each of the classes.</description>
