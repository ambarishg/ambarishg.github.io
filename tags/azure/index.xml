      <description>What are we trying to do We will build a very simple recommendation engine using Text Data. To demostrate this we would use a case study approach and build a recommendation engine for a non profit organization Career Village. I have detailed post on the methodology of the recommendation engine in the post here. In this post we will show of how we train, infer and deploy the solution in Azure.</description>

      <description>What are we trying to do Predict the Quality of Red Wine using Tensorflow Keras deep learning framework given certain attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol
We divide our approach into 2 major blocks:
 Building the Model in Azure ML Inference from the Model in Azure ML  Building the model in Azure ML has the following steps:</description>
