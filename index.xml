      <description>Binomial Probability distribution has the following characteristics:
  A fixed number of trials n. e.g., 20 coin toss , 40 students
  A binary outcome, a success and a failure. Probability of success is p, probability of failure is 1-p. e.g., head or tail in a coin toss , pass or fail of sttudents in an exam, positive and negative results of a test of a patient.
  Constant probability for each trial.</description>

      <description>Probability distribution is also known as Probability function.
 This gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes A mathematical function which maps each possible outcome x to the probability p(x) The probabilities must all sum or integrate to 1  Discrete and Continous Probability distribution Discrete probability functions can take only discrete values. Examples include Dead/ Alive , numbers obtained by rolling a die, treatment / placebo, whole numbers
Continuous probability functions can take any value within a range.</description>

      <description>From the TensorFlow documentation word embeddings documentation
 Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding.
  Importantly, you do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify).
  Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer).</description>

      <description>Every third bite of food relies on pollination by bees. Honey beehive losses are quite prevalent due to the diseased bees.
While many indications of hive strength and health are visible on the inside of the hive, frequent check-ups on the hive are time-consuming and disruptive to the bees&#39; workflow and hive in general. By investigating the bees that leave the hive, we can gain a more complete understanding of the hive itself.</description>

      <description>Cross Entropy Loss In a supervised learning problem for predicting classes, we predict probabilities for the classes. To determine how successful we are predicting the classes, we require a loss function.
Cross-Entropy loss function provides a loss function to calculate the loss between the actual classes and the predicted probabilities
This can be represented as
 Get the predicted probability of the class Get the actual label of the class ( 1 or 0 ) Multiply the actual label with the log of the predicted probability of the class Sum the values obtained from each of the classes Multiply by -1 the value obtained in Step 4  This is the loss for a single observation.</description>

      <description>DataStores
In Azure ML, datastores are references to storage locations, such as Azure Storage blob containers. Every workspace has a default datastore - usually the Azure storage blob container that was created with the workspace.
When data is uploaded into the datastore through the following code
default_ds.upload_files(files=[&amp;#39;data/diabetes.csv&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;data/diabetes2.csv&amp;#39;], # Upload the diabetes csv files in /data target_path=&amp;#39;diabetes-data/&amp;#39;, # Put it in a folder path in the datastore overwrite=True, # Replace existing files of the same name show_progress=True) we can see the files in the Azure Storage Account &amp;gt; Containers &amp;gt; Blob Stores</description>

      <description>An experiment is a grouping of many runs from a specified script. It always belongs to a workspace. When we submit a run, we provide an experiment name. Information for the run is stored under that experiment. If the name doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when we submit an experiment, a new experiment is automatically created.
  A run is a single execution of a training script. An experiment will typically contain multiple runs.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with 2 of my experiences with machine learning in data science competitions and writing a research paper. This will give us enough motivation to understand why platforms such as AzureML are required.
Story 1 - A data science competition  I participated in a data science competition that required predicting time series data. For this, I tried 5 different algorithms Arima, ETS, Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, and Random Forest. I also used several imputation techniques which also involved a number of hyperparameters.</description>

      <description>Parameter
A variable of a model that the machine learning system trains on its own. For example, weights are parameters whose values the machine learning system gradually learns through successive training iterations.
Hyperparameter
The &amp;ldquo;knobs&amp;rdquo; that we tweak during successive runs of training a model. For example, learning rate is a hyperparameter.
Hyperparameters have the following properties
  Search space - The set of hyperparameter values tried during hyperparameter tuning is known as the search space.</description>

      <description>An environment is the encapsulation of the environment where training or scoring of the machine learning model happens. The environment specifies
 the Python packages, environment variables, and software settings around your training and scoring scripts.  Environments are of three types curated, user-managed, and system-managed.
Curated environments are provided by Azure Machine Learning and are available in the workspace by default.
In user-managed environments, the person is responsible for setting up the environment and installing every package that the training script needs on the compute target.</description>

      <description>Honoured to win the 1st prize in a Data Science competition Random Walk of Penguins hosted by DrivenData. Sharing the winning approach here.
Introduction Penguins are among the most charismatic animals in the world and have captured the imaginations of news-makers, scientists, film producers, and the general public. Beyond their general intrinsic value, they are considered important ecosystem indicators. In other words, monitoring these beautiful species can tell us a lot about the general health of the Antarctic because penguins are important krill and fish predators, and changes (natural or anthropogenic) that influence prey abundance and environmental conditions will ultimately be detected through changes in distribution or population size.</description>

      <description>Honoured to win the 1st prize in a Data Science competition Random Walk of Penguins hosted by DrivenData. Sharing the winning approach here.
Introduction Penguins are among the most charismatic animals in the world and have captured the imaginations of news-makers, scientists, film producers, and the general public. Beyond their general intrinsic value, they are considered important ecosystem indicators. In other words, monitoring these beautiful species can tell us a lot about the general health of the Antarctic because penguins are important krill and fish predators, and changes (natural or anthropogenic) that influence prey abundance and environmental conditions will ultimately be detected through changes in distribution or population size.</description>

      <description>Sigmoid function takes values between 0 and 1
$ {sigmoid} = \frac {e^x} {( 1+ e^x )} $
This is used in logistic regression.
The sigmoid graph is generated by the R code provided below.
Softmax function is used to calculate the probablities in multiple classes. Suppose we have a image of a digit. We want to calculate whether it is a 1, 2, 3, and so on. Softmax would provide the probablity for each of the classes.</description>

      <description>In 2016, California investigators used state wiretapping laws 563 times to capture 7.8 million communications from 181,000 people, and only 19% of these communications were incriminating. The year&amp;rsquo;s wiretaps cost nearly $30 million.
We know this, and much more, now that the California Department of Justice (CADOJ) for the first time has released to EFF the dataset underlying its annual wiretap report to the state legislature.

In Azure Machine Learning, a pipeline is a workflow of machine learning tasks in which each task is implemented as a step.
 Steps can be arranged sequentially or in parallel Each step can be run on a specific compute target, making it possible to combine different types of processing as required to achieve an overall goal A pipeline can be executed as a process by running the pipeline as an experiment Each step in the pipeline runs on its allocated compute target as part of the overall experiment run.</description>

      <description>Approaches towards a session not just involve the topic matter, but also creating influence and motivating students to learn. I think you exactly did that. It was an absolute privilege to be able to attend your session. Thoroughly enjoyed your session. A bit of coding demonstration alongside theory was a great idea. It was an extensive 6.5 hrs long session with an hour break in between.</description>
