> Approaches towards a session not just involve the topic matter, but also creating influence and motivating students to learn. I think you exactly did that. It was an absolute privilege to be able to attend your session. Thoroughly enjoyed your session. A bit of coding demonstration alongside theory was a great idea. It was an extensive 6.5 hrs long session with an hour break in between.
