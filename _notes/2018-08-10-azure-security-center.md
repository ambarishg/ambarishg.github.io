* Azure Security Center (ASC), helps protect workloads running in Azure, on-premises, and in other clouds                 

* Azure Security Center is offered in two tiers: Free and Standard          

Security Center Standard includes:

* **Hybrid security** â€“ A unified view of security across all your `on-premises and cloud workloads`. Apply security policies and continuously evaluate the security of your `hybrid cloud workloads` to ensure compliance with security standards. Collect, search, and analyze security data from a variety of sources, including firewalls and other partner solutions.        

* **Advanced threat detection** - Uses advanced analytics and the **Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph** to get an edge over evolving cyber-attacks. Leverage built-in behavioral analytics and machine learning to identify attacks and zero-day exploits. Monitor networks, machines, and cloud services for incoming attacks and post-breach activity. Streamline investigation with interactive tools and contextual threat intelligence.      

* **Access and application controls** - Blocks malware and other unwanted applications by applying whitelisting recommendations adapted to your specific workloads and powered by machine learning. Reduce the network attack surface with just-in-time, controlled access to management ports on Azure VMs, drastically reducing exposure to brute force and other network attacks.
