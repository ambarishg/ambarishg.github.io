### Introduction

ANOVA is a statistical method for determining the existence of differences
among several population means.           


The required assumptions of ANOVA:                 

1. We assume independent random sampling from each of the **r**
populations.          

2. We assume that the r populations under study are normally distributed,
with means $$\mu_i$$ that may or may not be equal, but with equal
variances $$\sigma^2$$.              


Sums of squares measure variation within the data SST is the total amount of
variation within the data set.**SSTR** is that part of the variation within the data that is
due to differences among the groups, and **SSE** is that part of the variation within the
data that is due to error—the part that cannot be explained by differences among the
groups. Therefore, **SSTR** is sometimes called the sum of squares between (variation
among the groups), and **SSE** is called the sum of squares within (within-group variation).
SSTR is also called the explained variation (because it is the part of the total variation
that can be explained by the fact that the data points belong to several different
groups). SSE is then called the unexplained variation.         

**Degrees of Freedom**          

* The degrees of freedom for SST is n - 1
* The degrees of freedom for SSTR(variation among groups) is r - 1
* The degrees of freedom for SSE(within-group variation) is n - r      

**Mean Square Treatment and Error**    

* Mean Square Treatment = MSTR =  SSTR/(r -1)       
* Mean Square Error = MSE = SSE/(n - r)     

**F Statistic**        

The test statistic in analysis of variance is
F = MSTR/MSE                   


### 9-19

In the theory of finance, a market for any asset or commodity is said to be
efficient if items of identical quality and other attributes (such as risk, in the case of
stocks) are sold at the same price. A Geneva-based oil industry analyst wants to test
the hypothesis that the spot market for crude oil is efficient. The analyst chooses the
Rotterdam oil market, and he selects Arabian Light as the type of oil to be studied.
(Differences in location may cause price differences because of transportation costs,
and differences in the type of oil—hence, in the quality of oil—also affect the price.

Therefore, both the type and the location must be fixed.) A random sample of eight
observations from each of four sources of the spot price of a barrel of oil during
February 2007 is collected. Data, in U.S. dollars per barrel, are as follows.              

U.K. Mexico U.A.E. Oman                   
62.10 56.30 55.60 53.11                 
63.20 59.45 54.22 52.90                    
55.80 60.02 53.18 53.75                  
56.90 60.00 56.12 54.10                   
61.20 58.75 60.01 59.03                    
60.18 59.13 53.20 52.35               
60.90 53.30 54.00 52.80                 
61.12 60.17 55.19 54.95                              

Based on these data, what should the analyst conclude about whether the market for
crude oil is efficient? Are conclusions valid only for the Rotterdam market? Are conclusions
valid for all types of crude oil? What assumptions are necessary for the
analysis? Do you believe that all the assumptions are met in this case? What are the
limitations, if any, of this study? Discuss.            


NULL Hypothesis is that items of identical quality and other attributes (such as risk, in the case of
stocks) are sold at the same price.

uk = data[c(1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29)]

mexico = data[c(2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30)]

uae = data[c(3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31)]

oman = data[c(4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32)]

l = length(uk)

l1 = l -1

**Mean Square Treatment and Error**

{% highlight R %}

MSTR = ( l*(mean(data) - mean(uk))^2 +
l*(mean(data) - mean(mexico))^2 +
l*(mean(data) - mean(uae))^2 +
l*(mean(data) - mean(oman))^2 )/3

MSTR

{% endhighlight %}

**SSE**

{% highlight R %}

n = length(data)
r = 4

MSE = (l1*sd(uk)^2 + l1*sd(mexico)^2 +l1*sd(uae)^2 + l1*sd(oman)^2)/(n-r)

MSE

n-r

{% endhighlight %}

**F Statistic**

{% highlight R %}

F = MSTR/MSE    

F

{% endhighlight %}

**Rejection region of the F test**

{% highlight R %}

qf(.025,r-1,n-r)
qf(.975,r-1,n-r)

{% endhighlight %}

The F statistic is 11.52481              
The rejection region is below 0.07095708 and greater than 3.626408             
The F statistic lies in the rejection region. Therefore we can reject the NULL Hypothesis that the items of identical quality and other attributes (such as risk, in the case of stocks) are sold at the same price.
