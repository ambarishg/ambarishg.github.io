###  Docker commands Part 1                     

<br/>

`docker pull alpine` - Pulls the `alpine image` from the docker registry               

`docker images`  - shows the docker images in the container                         

Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that you are going to use the 
`docker run` command.                   

`docker run alpine ls -l`                                         

`docker ps ` - The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.                  
`docker ps -a` - What you see above is a list of all containers that you ran
