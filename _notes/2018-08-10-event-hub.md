Azure Event Hubs is a **Big Data streaming platform** and **event ingestion service**, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs can process and store events, data, or telemetry produced by distributed software and devices. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

Event Hubs is used in some of the following common scenarios:            

* Anomaly detection (fraud/outliers)          
* Application logging                      
* Analytics pipelines, such as clickstreams               
* Live dashboarding                   
* Archiving data                  
* Transaction processing                  
* User telemetry processing                    
* Device telemetry streaming

* **Event producers**: Any entity that sends data to an event hub. Event publishers can publish events using HTTPS or AMQP 1.0 or Apache Kafka (1.0 and above)              

* **Partitions**: Each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream.            

* **Consumer groups**: A view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream    independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.       

* **Throughput units**: Pre-purchased units of capacity that control the throughput capacity of Event Hubs.             

* **Event receivers**: Any entity that reads event data from an event hub. All Event Hubs consumers connect via the AMQP 1.0 session, and events are delivered through the session as they become available.
