Advisor is a **personalized cloud consultant** that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry and then recommends solutions that can help you improve the cost effectiveness, performance, high availability, and security of your Azure resources.                 

With Advisor, you can:

* Get proactive, actionable, and personalized best practices recommendations.                 
* Improve the performance, security, and high availability of your resources, as you identify opportunities to `reduce your overall Azure spend`.
* Get recommendations with proposed actions inline.               

The recommendations are divided into four categories:

* **High Availability**: To ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications.           
* **Security**: To detect threats and vulnerabilities that might lead to security breaches.                 
* **Performance**: To improve the speed of your applications.               
* **Cost**: To optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending.
