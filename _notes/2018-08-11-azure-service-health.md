Azure Service Health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues in Azure services affect you. It can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you updated as the issue resolves. It can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.

Azure Service Health is composed of:

* **Azure status** - A global view of the health of Azure services
* **Service Health** - A `personalized view` of the health of your Azure services
* **Resource Health** - A deeper view of the health of the `individual resources provisioned to you` by your Azure services
