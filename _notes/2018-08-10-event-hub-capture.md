**Azure Event Hubs Capture** enables you to automatically deliver the streaming data in Event Hubs to an **Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Store account** of your choice, with the added flexibility of specifying a time or size interval. Setting up Capture is fast, there are no administrative costs to run it, and it scales automatically with `Event Hubs throughput units`. Event Hubs Capture is the easiest way to load streaming data into Azure, and enables you to focus on data processing rather than on data capture.             

Event Hubs Capture enables you to process real-time and batch-based pipelines on the same stream. This means you can build solutions that grow with your needs over time. Whether you're building batch-based systems today with an eye towards future real-time processing, or you want to add an efficient cold path to an existing real-time solution, Event Hubs Capture makes working with streaming data easier
