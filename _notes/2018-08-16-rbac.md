**How RBAC works**         

The way you control access to resources using RBAC is to create role assignments. This is a key concept to understand – it’s how permissions are enforced. A role assignment consists of three elements: `security principal, role definition, and scope`.

**Security Principal**

A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, or service principal that is requesting access to Azure resources.             

*Service principal* - A security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources. You can think of it as a user identity (username and password or certificate) for an application.

**Role Definition**
A role definition is a collection of permissions.

**Scope**       

Scope is the boundary that the access applies to. When you assign a role, you can further limit the actions allowed by defining a scope.
