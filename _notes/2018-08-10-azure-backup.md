### Azure Backup          
<br/>

* Azure Backup is a simple yet powerful service that allows you to back up your files to the reliable storage on Azure                

* Azure Backup offers two types of replication: locally redundant storage and geo-redundant storage.                 

* To back up your files, a **Backup Vault on Azure** needs to be created and also deploy a **Backup agent**. Finally, we need to configure which files or folders to be backed up and backup schedules
